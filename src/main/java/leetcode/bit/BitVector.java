/**
 * Given an input file with four billion integers, provide an algorithm to generate an integer which is not contained in the file. Assume you have 1 GB of memory.
 FOLLOW UP
 What if you have only 10 MB of memory?

 Solution: There are a total of 2^32, or 4 billion, distinct integers possible.
 We have 1 GB of memory, or 8 billion bits.Thus, with 8 billion bits, we can map all
 possible integers to a distinct bit with the available memory. The logic is as follows:
 1. Create a bit vector (BV) of size 4 billion.
 2. Initialize BV with all 0â€™s
 3. Scan all numbers (num) from the file and write BV[num] = 1;
 4. Now scan again BV from 0th index
 5. Return the first index which has 0 value.
