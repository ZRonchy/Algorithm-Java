/**
 * Given a graph and a source vertex in graph,
 * find shortest paths from source to all vertices in the given graph.
 * 1) Create a set sptSet (shortest path tree set) that keeps track of vertices included in
 * shortest path tree, i.e., whose minimum distance from source is calculated and finalized.
 * Initially, this set is empty.
 * 2) Assign a distance value to all vertices in the input graph. Initialize all distance values as
 * INFINITE. Assign distance value as 0 for the source vertex so that it is picked first.
 * 3) While sptSet doesnâ€™t include all vertices
 * a) Pick a vertex u which is not there in sptSetand has minimum distance value.
 * b) Include u to sptSet.
 * c) Update distance value of all adjacent vertices of u. To update the distance values,
 * iterate through all adjacent vertices. For every adjacent vertex v, if sum of distance value
 * of u (from source) and weight of edge u-v, is less than the distance value of v, then update
 * the distance value of v.
