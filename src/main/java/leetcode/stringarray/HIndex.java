/**
 * Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher,
 * write a function to compute the researcher's h-index. A scientist has index h if h of
 * his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more
 * than h citations each.

 For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in
 total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher
 has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.
