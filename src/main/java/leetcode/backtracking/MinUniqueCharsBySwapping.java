/**
 * Given two strings A and B. Minimize the number of unique characters
 * in string A by either swapping A[i] with B[i] or keeping it unchanged.
 * The number of swaps can be greater than or equal to 0. Note that A[i]
 * can be swapped only with same index element in B. Print the minimum number
 * of unique characters. Constraints: 0 < length of A â‰¤ 15.

 Examples:

 Input : A = ababa
 B = babab
 Output : 1
 Swapping all b's in string A, with
 a's in string B results in string
 A having all characters as a.

 Input : A = abaaa
 B = bbabb
 Output : 2
 Initially string A has 2 unique characters. Swapping at any index does not change this count.

 Approach: The problem can be solved using backtracking. Create a map in which key is A[i]
 and value is count of corresponding character. The size of the map tells the number of distinct
 characters as only those elements which are present in string A are present as key in map. At
 every index position, there are two choices: either swap A[i] with B[i] or keep A[i] unchanged.
 Start from index 0 and do following for each index:

 Keep A[i] unchanged, increment count of A[i] by one in map and call recursively for next index.
 Backtrack by decreasing count of A[i] by one, swap A[i] with B[i], increment count of A[i] by
 one in map and again recursively call for next index.
